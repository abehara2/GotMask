# Got a Mask?

So far, I have completed a purely OpenCV implementation of the script using C++ and Python. Here is a video of the real time object detection code run using my Macbook Webcam on my little sister. I will be writing implementations with YOLO based R-CNN's on masked-person data sets later in order to increase robustness and accuracy of the detection. <br/> <br/>

The gif quality is quite rough as Github only accepts smaller videos and files, but if you want to see a clearer video with the text not as pixelated check out this public YouTube URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMjjTuqWezg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMjjTuqWezg)<br/> <br/>
