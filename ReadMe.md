# Got a Mask?

So far, I have completed a purely OpenCV implementation of the script using C++ and Python. Here is a video of the real time object detection code run using my Macbook Webcam on my little sister. I will be writing implementations with YOLO based R-CNN's on masked-person data sets later in order to increase robustness and accuracy of the detection.
